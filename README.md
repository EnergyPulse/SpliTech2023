This documentation provides an overview regarding [Iot Day WORKSHOP](https://iotday.splitech.org/), the first significant event of [SpliTech2023](https://2023.splitech.org/home) conference on June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2023. The event was conceptualized as a tutorial session, dedicated to a specific IoT Topic entitled "_Design and development of an IoT learning system for health-related applications_".

The session combines academic concepts with practical exercises in a hands-on approach to deploy the theoretical knowledge acquired into a practical use case. Attendees are encouraged to realize their own prototypes based on provided hands-on experience, while future development possibilities could be explored respectively.
